## Installation

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("com.vynatix:vault:3.17.4")
}
```

## Quick Start

1. Define your vault with assets:

```kotlin
class UserVault(vaultFactory: VaultFactory) : IVault by vaultFactory() {
    val username by asset { "John Doe" }
    val email by asset { "none" }
    val isLoggedIn by asset { false }
}
```

2. Perform atomic operations:

```kotlin
suspend fun login() = userVault.operation("login") {
    userVault.username("Jane Doe")
    userVault.email("jane@example.com")
    userVault.isLoggedIn(true)
}
```

3. Observe state changes:

```kotlin
userVault.username.onEach { username ->
    println("Username updated: $username")
}.launchIn(scope)
```

## Key Concepts
### Built for Performance
Vault doesn't just make state management safer‚Äîit makes it faster. Through innovative features like operation pooling and efficient state tracking, Vault minimizes memory allocations and optimizes state updates.
### Assets

Assets are state containers and each asset is:
- Type-safe
- Reactive
- Transaction-aware
- Repository-backed
- Automatically managed
```kotlin
class ProfileVault(vaultFactory: VaultFactory) : IVault by vaultFactory() {
    val name by asset { "" }
    val bio by asset { "" }
    val socialLinks by asset { listOf<String>() }
}
```

### Transactions
Imagine if you could manage your application state with the same reliability as database transactions. That's exactly what Vault brings to the table. Every state change in Vault is wrapped in a transaction that either completes successfully or rolls back automatically, ensuring your application state remains consistent even when errors occur.

All state modifications are wrapped in transactions:

```kotlin
vault.operation("updateProfile") {
    vault.name("Jane Doe")
    vault.bio("Software Engineer")
    // Automatic rollback if any operation fails
}
```

### Repository Integration

Vault seamlessly integrates with your data layer through its repository pattern:

```kotlin
class UserRepository : IRepository<String> {
    private val _dataFlow = MutableSharedFlow<String>(replay = 1)

    override fun set(value: String) {
        _dataFlow.tryEmit(value)
    }

    override fun flow(): SharedFlow<String> = _dataFlow.asSharedFlow()
}

// Bind repository to asset
userVault.username.repository(UserRepository())
```

### Middleware

Add cross-cutting concerns with middleware:

```kotlin
data object LoggingMiddleware : Middleware<IVault>() {
    override suspend fun onTransactionStarted(context: MiddlewareContext<IVault>) {
        println("Operation started: ${context.transaction.useCaseId}")
    }
}

userVault.middlewares(LoggingMiddleware)
```

## The Future of State Management

## How Vault Compares to Other Solutions

Let's look at how Vault stacks up against other popular state management solutions:

### Vault vs Redux

While Redux pioneered unidirectional data flow and centralized state management, Vault takes these concepts further:

```kotlin
// Redux approach
const userReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'UPDATE_USER':
      return { ...state, username: action.payload }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Vault approach
class UserVault(vaultFactory: VaultFactory) : IVault by vaultFactory() {
    val username by asset { "" }
}

vault.operation("updateUser") {
    vault.username("newName")
}
```

**Key Advantages over Redux:**
- No boilerplate actions or reducers
- Built-in transaction safety
- Type-safe by default
- Automatic state rollback
- Direct property access
- Built-in persistence layer

### Vault vs MobX

MobX brought reactive programming to state management. Vault builds on this foundation:

```kotlin
// MobX approach
class UserStore {
    @observable username = ""
    
    @action
    setUsername(name) {
        this.username = name
    }
}

// Vault approach
class UserVault(vaultFactory: VaultFactory) : IVault by vaultFactory() {
    val username by asset { "" }
}
```

**Key Advantages over MobX:**
- Native Kotlin coroutines integration
- Transaction-based operations
- Built-in repository pattern
- More predictable state changes
- Better testing support
- No decorators needed

### Vault vs BLoC

BLoC pattern brought stream-based state management to Flutter. Vault offers similar benefits with additional safety:

```kotlin
// BLoC approach
class UserBloc extends Bloc<UserEvent, UserState> {
    Stream<UserState> mapEventToState(UserEvent event) async* {
        yield UserState(username: event.username)
    }
}

// Vault approach
class UserVault(vaultFactory: VaultFactory) : IVault by vaultFactory() {
    val username by asset { "" }
}
```

**Key Advantages over BLoC:**
- Simpler mental model
- Automatic error recovery
- Built-in transaction support
- More intuitive API
- Property-based access
- Better type inference

### Vault vs Mobius

Spotify's Mobius offers pure functional state management. Vault provides similar benefits with more flexibility:

```kotlin
// Mobius approach
data class Model(val username: String)
fun update(model: Model, event: Event): Next<Model, Effect>

// Vault approach
class UserVault(vaultFactory: VaultFactory) : IVault by vaultFactory() {
    val username by asset { "" }
}
```

**Key Advantages over Mobius:**
- More familiar property-based API
- Built-in persistence
- Simpler integration
- Transaction safety
- Direct state access when needed
- Less boilerplate

## Best Practices

1. **Group Related States**: Organize related states in a single vault
2. **Meaningful Operation Names**: Use descriptive names for operations
3. **Keep Transactions Small**: Focus on atomic operations
4. **Error Handling**: Let the vault handle rollbacks automatically
5. **Repository Pattern**: Use repositories for data persistence
6. **Middleware for Cross-cutting Concerns**: Implement logging, analytics, etc.

## Performance Considerations

- Operations are pooled for memory efficiency
- State changes are tracked efficiently
- Middleware execution is optimized
- Flow operations are cold by default
